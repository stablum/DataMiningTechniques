Data Mining Techniques

## Setup

Python version 3 needs to be installed on the local system

The following packages are required for running most the scripts:

 * numpy
 * scipy
 * matplotlib

If those packages are installed, then ``pylab`` will be available on the system. Remember to install
the specific versions for Python version 3.

### In Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib

### In Windows
    
Use a Python package manager, such as ``pip``. Maybe 
[this tutorial](http://arunrocks.com/guide-to-install-python-or-pip-on-windows/)
can be helpful.
   

## Running

    python3 ./run.py ratiocharts
